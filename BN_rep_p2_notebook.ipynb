    "means probability distribution of any x conditioned to every possible combination of its parents (A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, ....A<sub>n</sub>).  All these probability combinations are gathered in a table called conditional probability table (CPT). The following figure shows an example of CPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images_p2/bn_semantics.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So every BN consists of **Topology**(graph) and **Local Conditional Probabilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Net *implicitly* encodes joint distribution. Joint distribution of random variables included in a BN is calculated using the product of all local conditional distributions. The following equation shows explicit formula:\n",

    "= P(+cavity) \\times P(+catch|+cavity) \\times P(-toothache|+cavity)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Joint Dist. Validation**\n",
    "So far we presented a joint distribution formula using BN, but we have not proved that it is a valid probability distribution.\n",
    "There are 2 conditions for every joint distribution:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    P(x_1,x_2,x_3,..,x_n) \\ge 0 \\qquad for \\quad every \\quad X_i\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first condition is directly concluded from the definition. For the second condition, we can replace joint destribution with the defined formula. If we sort X<sub>i</sub>s as topological order, we have:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{X_1, X_2, ..,X_n}  P(x_1,x_2,x_3,..,x_n) = \\sum_{X_1, X_2, ..,X_n} \\prod_{j \\in \\{1,..n\\}} P(x_i|parents(X_i)) \\\\\n",
