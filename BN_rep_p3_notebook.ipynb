    "    Low pressure causes rain ( P( +y | +x ) = 1 ), high pressure causes no rain ( P( -y | -x ) = 1 ), rain causes traffic ( P( +z | +y ) = 1 ), no rain causes no traffic ( P( -z | -y ) = 1 ) and we suppose that having low pressure or high pressure is a random process so we have P(+x) = P(-x) = 0.5 .<br/>\n",
